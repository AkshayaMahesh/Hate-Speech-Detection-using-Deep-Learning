# Hate Speech Detection

🚫🤬 This project aims to detect and classify hate speech in social media posts and other text data. 📈🕵️‍♀️

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify instances of hate speech, as well as distinguish between different types of hate speech (e.g. racism, sexism, homophobia, etc.). 🤖🔍

## Dataset

We are using a publicly available dataset of tweets labeled as hate speech or not. The dataset contains over 10,000 tweets, with annotations for hate speech, offensive language, and neither. 📊🐦

## Approach

Our approach involves pre-processing the text data to remove noise and irrelevant information, then using a variety of machine learning algorithms to classify the tweets as hate speech or not. We are also experimenting with deep learning models to see if they can improve our results. 🤓💻

## Results

So far, our best performing model has an accuracy of 87% on a held-out test set. We are continuing to refine our approach and explore new techniques to improve our results. 📈🔬
